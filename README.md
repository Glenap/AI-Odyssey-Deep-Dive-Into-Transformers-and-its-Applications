## 🌐 Overview

Transformers have transformed (pun intended) the landscape of Natural Language Processing and beyond. This project aims to:

- Explore the theory behind Transformer models
- Implement core architectures (e.g., Encoder-Decoder, BERT, GPT)
- Apply transformers to tasks like text classification, summarization, translation, and vision
- Benchmark performance and interpretability using modern tools
